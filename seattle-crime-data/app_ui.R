      our explored data, there is information on details such as the
      location of incidents, Police Sectors that got involved, what type
      of crime was called in, along with many other records that may
      provide insight on a particular event/report. Evaluating all three

      most prevalant; such patterns will then become a lot easier for the
      Police to detect and track, ensuring optimal civilian safety.

      reports, and unrealistic claims that ultimately
      waste everyone's time. Faulty or petty 911 calls
      could distract officers from very important tasks
      and even break a lead on actual crime. Patterns
      found in the displayed data could reveal if there

      is more criminal activity occuring."),

      that is booming with career opportunities,

      more protection in these areas to fight back
      against criminal activity.")

      p("One major takeaway from this project is that the
      Northern precinct of Seattle has the highest
      concentration of criminal activity in recent years.
      This insight is meaningful because the police
      department can use this knowledge to place more
      officers in the Northern areas of Seattle. Another
      major takeaway from this project is that there is
      a trend with regards to the areas that have more criminal
      activity and the areas with more 911 calls. This is a
      valuable insight since it shows that people are being
      proactive in combating criminal activity and are taking
      the initiative to stand up for the safety of themselves
      and others. A final takeaway from this project is that,
      for the past 12 years, the downtown commercial
      neighborhood in Seattle has experienced the most criminal
      activity.This is significant because people who are
      making housing decisions can factor in the safety of a
      community while determining where to get a property.
      Additionally, police can take further necessary action to
      make this community, and other neighborhoods with high
      criminal activity into safer places for everyone.")
