### **Domain of interest: Crime**

_Why are you interested in this field/domain?_

We are interested in this field/domain because identifying patterns in past crimes can help professionals make informed decisions about how to combat these acts in the future. Police officers, government officials, and others can use insights from this data to try implementing and enforcing different solutions to reduce crime rates. We believe that this type of data-driven decision making can have a positive impact on cities all around the world.
